# NumPy Learning Repository

This repository documents my structured learning and practice with **NumPy**, a fundamental Python library for numerical and scientific computing.  
It serves as the first stage of my Data Science learning journey and includes well-organized notebooks, code examples, and exercises.

##  Introduction
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core library for:
- High-performance multidimensional array and matrix operations
- Mathematical, logical, statistical, and random number functions
- Serving as the foundation for other data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn

This repository contains my practical implementations of NumPy concepts with detailed explanations.

##  Learning Objectives
The primary objectives of this learning phase are:
- To understand NumPy arrays and their advantages over native Python lists
- To perform array creation, indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- To execute mathematical, statistical, and logical operations
- To explore broadcasting and vectorization for computational efficiency
- To utilize NumPyâ€™s random module for simulations and data generation
